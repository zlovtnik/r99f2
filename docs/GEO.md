# Comprehensive Geographic Expansion Optimization (GEO) Strategy
## LR Sunrise Construction - Portland, Maine

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a strategic framework for geographic expansion and local search optimization for LR Sunrise Construction. The strategy focuses on dominating local search results across Maine service areas while establishing a foundation for controlled geographic expansion. The implementation combines technical SEO, content strategy, local citations, and digital marketing tactics specifically designed for the construction industry.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Digital Infrastructure

The website demonstrates several strong foundational elements that position the business well for geographic optimization. The technical implementation includes structured data markup through JSON-LD schemas for local business information, service offerings, and breadcrumb navigation. The site architecture supports dynamic service area pages with dedicated landing pages for each geographic location served. The mobile-responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, which is critical given that approximately sixty-five percent of local searches occur on mobile devices.

The current service area structure shows coverage primarily focused on Portland and immediate surrounding communities. The existing ZIP code targeting provides granular geographic precision, though opportunities exist to expand this framework systematically.

### Competitive Landscape

The construction and roofing services market in Maine exhibits moderate to high competition in urban centers like Portland, with decreasing competition intensity in rural and suburban markets. National franchise operations like LeafFilter and local established contractors compete for the same customer base. The key differentiators for success include response time guarantees, local expertise, senior discounts, and established community presence.

---

## Strategic Framework

### Phase One: Local Market Dominance (Months 1-6)

The initial phase concentrates resources on establishing absolute dominance in existing service areas before expanding geographic reach. This approach builds a strong foundation of reviews, citations, and local authority that supports future expansion efforts.

#### Google Business Profile Optimization

The cornerstone of local visibility remains the Google Business Profile. The business should maintain multiple location-specific profiles if serving distinct geographic markets, though care must be taken to comply with Google's guidelines regarding legitimate physical locations or service area boundaries.

For each profile, the business information must remain absolutely consistent across all platforms. This includes the exact business name format, phone number presentation, address formatting, and website URL. The primary category should be "Roofing Contractor" with secondary categories including "General Contractor," "Siding Contractor," and "Gutter Contractor" to capture broader search intent.

The business description should incorporate location-specific keywords naturally while emphasizing unique value propositions. For example: "LR Sunrise Construction serves Portland and surrounding Maine communities with expert roofing installation, siding replacement, and general contracting services. Family-owned since [founding year], we offer same-day emergency response and senior discounts to our neighbors throughout Cumberland County."

High-quality photos prove essential for local search performance and conversion. The profile should include exterior and interior business photos if applicable, team member photos showing actual crew members, before-and-after project galleries organized by service type, equipment and vehicle photos displaying company branding, and process photos documenting various project stages. Each image should include descriptive filenames and alt text incorporating location and service keywords.

Posts should publish at minimum weekly, covering seasonal services and promotions, completed project highlights with customer permission, team introductions and company culture elements, educational content about maintenance and repairs, and local community involvement activities. Each post should include a clear call-to-action and relevant service link.

The questions and answers section requires active management, with the business proactively adding frequently asked questions about services, pricing transparency where possible, emergency availability, warranty information, and service area coverage. Monitoring for new questions and responding within twenty-four hours demonstrates engagement and builds trust.

#### Review Generation and Management

Reviews function as the most powerful local ranking factor and trust signal. A systematic approach to review generation should target thirty to fifty high-quality reviews within the first six months, distributed across Google, Facebook, Yelp, and industry-specific platforms like Houzz and Angi.

The review request timing matters significantly. The optimal moment occurs immediately after successful project completion when customer satisfaction peaks. The request process should be simple and friction-free, ideally via text message or email with direct links to preferred review platforms.

Response protocols require addressing every review regardless of sentiment. Positive reviews should receive personalized thank-you responses within forty-eight hours, mentioning specific project details when possible and reinforcing the company's commitment to quality. Negative reviews demand immediate attention within twenty-four hours, with responses taking the conversation offline while publicly demonstrating accountability and solution-oriented approach.

#### Citation Building and NAP Consistency

Citations represent mentions of the business name, address, and phone number across the web. These signals significantly impact local search rankings. The strategy should pursue citations on major data aggregators including Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Factual, and Foursquare, which feed information to numerous downstream directories.

Industry-specific directories provide high-value citations for construction businesses. Priority platforms include Angi (formerly Angie's List), HomeAdvisor, Houzz, Porch, BuildZoom, Thumbtack, the Better Business Bureau, and chamber of commerce listings for each service area community.

General business directories still contribute value, including Yelp, Facebook Business, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Yellow Pages, Manta, Merchant Circle, and Hotfrog. Local directories specific to Maine communities should be identified and utilized, including community websites, local business associations, and regional news sites with business directories.

Every citation must maintain perfect NAP consistency. The business name should appear exactly as "LR Sunrise Construction" without variations. The address should use consistent formatting including abbreviation styles. The phone number should maintain consistent presentation including area code formatting and punctuation. The website URL should include the protocol and remain consistent across all citations.

### Phase Two: Content-Driven Geographic Expansion (Months 4-12)

Content marketing establishes topical authority while targeting specific geographic and service combinations. The strategy employs a hub-and-spoke model with comprehensive service pages as hubs and location-specific variations as spokes.

#### Service Area Landing Pages

Each service area requires a dedicated landing page optimized for location-specific searches. The existing ServiceAreaPage component provides the structural foundation, but content depth requires enhancement.

Each page should feature a compelling H1 headline following the format: "[Service Type] Services in [City Name], Maine | LR Sunrise Construction." The opening paragraph must immediately address local relevance, incorporating the city name, county, and region while highlighting specific service expertise.

Local market context adds authority and relevance. This includes discussion of common roofing challenges specific to Maine's climate such as ice dam prevention, heavy snow load considerations, and coastal weather durability requirements. Reference to local architectural styles prevalent in each community helps demonstrate local expertise. Discussion of local building codes and permit requirements shows professional competence. Mention of recent projects in the area (with customer permission) builds credibility.

Each service area page should incorporate unique content elements including a locally-relevant FAQ section addressing common questions specific to that market, customer testimonials from residents of that area, recent project gallery filtered by location, seasonal service recommendations based on local climate patterns, and information about response times and service availability specific to that geography.

#### Hyperlocal Blog Content

The blog serves as the primary vehicle for long-tail keyword targeting and establishing expertise. Content should publish at minimum twice monthly, covering diverse topic categories aligned with customer search intent throughout the buying journey.

Seasonal preparation guides resonate strongly with homeowners. Examples include "Preparing Your Portland Home's Roof for Winter: A Complete Guide," "Spring Roof Inspection Checklist for Maine Homeowners," and "Hurricane Preparation for Coastal Maine Properties." These articles should provide genuine value while naturally incorporating service calls-to-action.

Educational problem-solving content targets homeowners researching issues. Topics might include "5 Signs Your Roof Needs Replacement (Maine Edition)," "Understanding Ice Dam Formation and Prevention in Cumberland County," and "Choosing the Right Siding Material for Maine's Climate." This content captures early-stage research traffic and builds trust.

Project showcase content demonstrates capability while targeting competitive keywords. Posts like "Complete Roof Replacement in South Portland: Case Study," "Victorian Home Restoration in Portland's West End," and "Modern Farmhouse Siding Installation in Falmouth" provide visual evidence of expertise while targeting specific service and location combinations.

Local market news and involvement shows community commitment. Coverage of participation in local home shows, sponsorship of community events, partnerships with local suppliers, and charitable initiatives builds brand affinity and generates local backlinks.

Each blog post should incorporate a structured content framework beginning with a compelling introduction that addresses the reader's question or problem directly, followed by comprehensive main content organized with descriptive subheadings, practical takeaways or action items, and clear next steps with relevant service links. Posts should include high-quality original images, optimized with descriptive alt text and file names incorporating location and service keywords.

#### Video Content Strategy

Video content significantly outperforms text in engagement metrics and increasingly appears in search results. The business should develop a video content library covering virtual tours of completed projects showing before, during, and after footage, process explanation videos demystifying installation procedures, maintenance tutorial videos providing homeowner value, customer testimonial videos with location context, and team introduction videos building personal connection.

Each video should be uploaded to YouTube with location-optimized titles, descriptions, and tags, embedded on relevant service and blog pages, transcribed with timestamps for accessibility and SEO value, and promoted through social channels and email marketing.

### Phase Three: Structured Geographic Expansion (Months 9-18)

Geographic expansion requires methodical planning rather than opportunistic growth. The expansion framework prioritizes markets based on multiple criteria including proximity to existing service areas to minimize travel costs and maximize efficiency, market size and demographic alignment with ideal customer profiles, competition intensity analysis identifying underserved markets, and economic indicators including median home values and homeownership rates.

#### Market Prioritization Matrix

Each potential expansion market should be scored across multiple dimensions. Proximity receives weighting based on drive time from the base location, with markets within thirty minutes rated higher than those requiring forty-five to sixty minutes. Market opportunity incorporates population size, housing density, median home age indicating replacement needs, and new construction activity.

Competition analysis evaluates the number of established competitors, their online presence strength, their review quantity and quality, and their service offerings and positioning. Markets with aging competitors showing weak digital presence represent prime opportunities.

Economic viability considers median household income, homeownership rates, average home values, and economic growth trends. Markets showing growth in these indicators suggest increasing demand for home improvement services.

#### Expansion Implementation Checklist

Before entering each new market, the business should complete a defined preparation sequence. This includes researching local building codes and permit requirements, identifying and establishing relationships with local suppliers, determining service logistics including travel time and emergency response capabilities, and planning initial marketing budget allocation.

The digital foundation for each new market requires creating dedicated service area landing pages, building initial citation presence in local directories, establishing relationships with local chambers of commerce and business associations, and identifying local link building opportunities including community websites and local news outlets.

The marketing launch sequence for each new market should include targeted direct mail to high-value neighborhoods, local social media advertising campaigns, participation in local home shows and community events, strategic partnerships with complementary local businesses such as real estate agents and property managers, and introduction offers to generate initial reviews and testimonials.

### Phase Four: Advanced Optimization and Authority Building (Months 12-24)

The advanced phase focuses on establishing market leadership through authority signals that competitors struggle to replicate.

#### Strategic Link Building

Link building remains a critical ranking factor despite evolving algorithms. The construction industry offers numerous legitimate link opportunities. Local sponsorships of youth sports teams, school programs, and community events typically generate links from organization websites and local news coverage.

Industry associations and certifications provide high-authority links. Memberships in organizations like the National Roofing Contractors Association, local builders associations, and manufacturer certification programs often include directory listings with backlinks.

Guest contribution opportunities exist on local news websites covering home improvement topics, real estate agent blogs featuring preferred contractor lists, local lifestyle blogs focusing on home and design, and community forums and neighborhood websites where the business can provide expert advice.

Supplier relationships can generate links when manufacturers feature certified installers, distributors highlight preferred contractors, and product review sites reference local installation professionals.

The business should track link acquisition metrics including total linking domains, domain authority of linking sites, relevance of linking content, and anchor text distribution. Natural link profiles show variety in anchor text rather than over-optimization of exact-match keywords.

#### Structured Data Expansion

Beyond basic LocalBusiness schema, the site should implement additional structured data types to maximize search visibility. Service schema markup on each service page clearly defines offerings, FAQ schema providing direct answers in search results, Review aggregate rating schema showcasing reputation, BreadcrumbList schema improving navigation understanding, and VideoObject schema for video content increasing rich snippet opportunities.

The implementation should be validated using Google's Rich Results Test tool, monitored through Google Search Console for errors or warnings, and updated regularly as schema.org specifications evolve.

#### Content Depth and Topical Authority

Establishing comprehensive topical authority requires creating content clusters around core service areas. For roofing services, this might include cluster topics such as roofing materials with separate detailed guides for asphalt shingles, metal roofing, tile roofing, and flat roofing systems; roofing problems covering leak diagnosis, ice dam prevention, storm damage, and aging signs; roofing processes including inspection procedures, repair techniques, replacement processes, and maintenance schedules; and regulatory topics addressing permits, codes, warranties, and insurance claims.

Each cluster should feature a comprehensive pillar page providing overview content and linking to detailed spoke pages addressing specific subtopics. This internal linking structure signals topical authority to search engines while improving user navigation.

## Technical Implementation

### Website Structure Optimization

The current website architecture provides a solid foundation, but several enhancements will maximize SEO performance.

#### URL Structure

URLs should follow a clear hierarchical pattern reflecting site organization. Service pages should use the format /services/[service-slug], service area pages should follow /service-areas/[city-slug], and blog posts should implement /blog/[post-slug]. This structure communicates page relationships to search engines and users.

URLs should avoid unnecessary parameters, maintain consistent lowercase formatting, use hyphens rather than underscores for word separation, and remain concise while descriptive.

#### Internal Linking Strategy

Internal links distribute page authority and guide search engine crawlers. The strategy should ensure homepage links to all top-level service pages and priority service areas, service pages link to relevant service area pages where those services are offered, service area pages link back to relevant service pages, blog posts link to related service and service area pages using descriptive anchor text, and breadcrumb navigation appears on all pages beyond the homepage.

The footer navigation should include links to all important pages ensuring no page sits more than three clicks from the homepage, which helps both user navigation and search engine crawling efficiency.

#### Page Speed Optimization

Page speed directly impacts both search rankings and conversion rates. Current optimization opportunities include image optimization through next-generation formats like WebP, proper sizing for device viewports, and lazy loading for below-fold images. Code optimization through JavaScript and CSS minification, elimination of render-blocking resources, and implementation of critical CSS for above-fold content will improve load times. Server optimization through enabling compression, leveraging browser caching with appropriate cache headers, and potentially implementing a content delivery network for static assets will reduce latency.

Regular performance testing using Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, and WebPageTest ensures optimization maintains effectiveness as content expands.

#### Mobile Optimization

With the majority of local searches occurring on mobile devices, mobile experience quality significantly impacts rankings and conversions. The responsive design should ensure proper rendering across device sizes, maintain readable font sizes without zooming, provide adequate tap target spacing for touch interaction, and implement mobile-specific features like click-to-call functionality for phone numbers.

The mobile experience should receive separate testing and optimization attention rather than treating it as an afterthought to desktop design.

#### Schema Markup Enhancement

The current schema implementation should be expanded to maximize rich result opportunities. Beyond the existing LocalBusiness and Service markup, additional schema types provide value including FAQ schema on service and service area pages, Review schema showcasing customer ratings, VideoObject schema for video content, HowTo schema for instructional content, and Article schema for blog posts.

Schema should be implemented as JSON-LD in the document head for easier maintenance and validation. Regular monitoring through Google Search Console identifies errors and validates successful implementation.

### Conversion Rate Optimization

Driving traffic accomplishes little without converting visitors to leads. The website should implement systematic conversion optimization.

#### Trust Signals

Multiple trust elements should appear throughout the site including licensing and insurance information prominently displayed, certification badges from manufacturers and industry associations, awards and recognition from local business organizations, years in business and project completion counts, and warranty information clearly explained.

#### Clear Calls-to-Action

Every page should provide obvious next steps for interested visitors. Primary actions include the phone number clickable on mobile, appearing in the header and above the fold; the contact form accessible within one click from any page; and the free estimate offer prominently featured with clear value proposition.

Secondary actions might include downloadable guides in exchange for email addresses, project galleries showcasing work quality, and customer testimonials building confidence in the decision.

#### Lead Capture Optimization

The contact form represents the primary conversion point and requires optimization attention. The form should remain as simple as possible, requesting only essential information, provide clear indication of required versus optional fields, include inline validation showing errors immediately, and confirm successful submission with clear next steps.

The hero section form provides early-funnel capture opportunity but should not create friction. Pre-filling available information from URL parameters or session storage as currently implemented reduces user effort.

## Local Search Marketing Integration

### Pay-Per-Click Advertising

Organic search optimization requires sustained effort over months to show results. Paid advertising provides immediate visibility while organic efforts mature.

#### Google Local Services Ads

Local Services Ads appear above standard search ads for home service businesses, showing the Google Guaranteed badge. The program requires background checks and licensing verification but provides high-quality leads at a pay-per-lead rather than pay-per-click model.

The business should complete the verification process, maintain high review ratings to ensure ad eligibility, respond quickly to leads as response time impacts ranking, and carefully manage service area boundaries and job type selections.

#### Google Search Ads

Standard search ads provide additional visibility for high-intent keywords. Campaign structure should separate campaigns by service type allowing budget allocation by service profitability, separate campaigns by geographic area enabling market-specific messaging and budget control, and utilize ad extensions including location extensions showing address and distance, call extensions enabling direct calling from ads, sitelink extensions highlighting specific services, and callout extensions emphasizing unique value propositions.

Keyword strategy should focus on high-intent searches showing clear service intent like "roof replacement Portland Maine" or "emergency roof repair near me," location-plus-service combinations targeting specific service area and service pairings, and competitor brand terms where appropriate and within budget.

Landing page alignment proves critical for quality score and conversion. Ads should direct to the most relevant page for the search query rather than generic homepage or contact pages.

#### Remarketing Campaigns

Most website visitors do not convert on first visit. Remarketing keeps the brand visible during the consideration phase. Display remarketing shows image ads to previous website visitors across the Google Display Network, search remarketing enables bid adjustments for previous visitors returning through organic or paid search, and dynamic remarketing can show specific services viewed to visitors across the web.

Remarketing audiences should segment by engagement level including all website visitors, high-engagement visitors spending significant time or viewing multiple pages, and abandoned form visitors who began but did not complete the contact form.

### Social Media Marketing

Social media primarily serves awareness and engagement rather than direct lead generation for construction businesses, but maintains importance in the customer journey.

#### Platform Prioritization

Facebook remains the dominant platform for home service businesses with its older demographic aligning well with homeowner profiles. The business page should post two to three times weekly with project photos, customer testimonials, seasonal tips, and community involvement.

Instagram provides visual showcase opportunity through project before-and-after photos, behind-the-scenes process videos, team culture content, and local community highlights. Stories offer opportunity for real-time project updates and engagement.

YouTube serves as the video content repository, housing project showcases, how-to videos, customer testimonials, and company information. Proper optimization with location keywords in titles and descriptions drives discovery.

LinkedIn targets commercial and property management opportunities rather than residential customers. Company page content should emphasize expertise, industry certifications, commercial project capabilities, and thought leadership.

#### Paid Social Advertising

Facebook and Instagram ads enable precise geographic and demographic targeting. Campaign objectives should include lead generation campaigns using native lead forms, website traffic campaigns driving to service pages, and engagement campaigns building page likes and post interactions.

Audience targeting should leverage location targeting by ZIP code or radius, demographic targeting by age, homeownership status, and income level, and interest targeting by home improvement interests, competitor page followers, and similar behaviors.

Creative best practices include high-quality project photos showing clear before-and-after results, video content showcasing process and results, customer testimonial quotes overlaid on project images, and seasonal messaging addressing timely needs.

## Measurement and Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators

Success requires defining clear metrics and establishing regular measurement cadence.

#### Traffic Metrics

Website traffic provides the foundation for all online conversions. Key metrics include total organic search traffic overall and trending monthly, organic traffic by landing page identifying top-performing content, organic traffic by service area showing geographic performance, and bounce rate and time on site indicating content relevance and quality.

Google Analytics 4 provides these insights through standard reports and custom segments. Regular review identifies trends requiring attention.

#### Ranking Metrics

Search position directly correlates with organic traffic volume. Tracking should include rankings for priority keywords overall and by service area, local pack ranking for core service terms in each target market, and overall keyword visibility measuring presence across target keyword universe.

Ranking tracking tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz provide automated monitoring and reporting.

#### Lead Generation Metrics

Website traffic matters only if it generates business results. Conversion metrics include total contact form submissions, phone call clicks from mobile, direction requests from local listings, and email inquiries.

Lead source tracking identifies which channels drive highest quality leads, informing budget allocation. Each lead source should be tracked including organic search, paid search, social media, direct traffic, and referral sources.

Conversion rate by traffic source reveals performance quality rather than just volume. A channel driving significant traffic but few conversions requires optimization attention.

#### Local Presence Metrics

Local search visibility requires monitoring local-specific metrics including Google Business Profile insights showing search appearances, website clicks, phone calls, and direction requests; review metrics tracking new review acquisition rate, average rating, response rate, and platform distribution; citation metrics monitoring total citation count, accuracy percentage, and duplicate listings requiring cleanup.

#### Revenue Attribution

Ultimately, marketing success requires connecting activity to revenue. While construction businesses often involve phone-based sales processes making direct attribution challenging, tracking should include lead-to-customer conversion rate by source, average project value by lead source, customer acquisition cost by channel, and customer lifetime value including repeat business and referrals.

### Reporting Framework

Regular reporting maintains focus and enables rapid optimization. Monthly reports should document traffic trends across key landing pages, ranking changes for priority keywords, lead volume and conversion rates by source, review acquisition and reputation metrics, and competitive landscape updates.

Quarterly business reviews should analyze campaign ROI and budget allocation, geographic expansion readiness and opportunities, content performance and topic opportunities, and strategic initiative progress against objectives.

---

## Risk Management and Competitive Defense

### Reputation Monitoring

Online reputation requires constant vigilance. Monitoring systems should track new reviews across all platforms daily, social media mentions of the business name, local news and blog mentions, and competitor review patterns and positioning.

Negative sentiment requires immediate response. The protocol should include acknowledging the issue publicly with empathy, taking detailed discussion offline to resolve privately, following up publicly after resolution when appropriate, and analyzing patterns in negative feedback to address systemic issues.

### Competitive Intelligence

Understanding competitive activity informs strategic decisions. Regular competitive analysis should monitor competitor ranking positions for priority keywords, competitor review acquisition rates and ratings, competitor website updates and new content, competitor advertising presence and messaging, and competitor service offerings and pricing positions.

Competitive advantages should be reinforced through marketing messaging while gaps in competitor offerings represent opportunity for differentiation.

### Algorithm Update Response

Search algorithms continuously evolve, occasionally causing significant ranking fluctuations. The strategy should include monitoring SEO news sources for announced algorithm updates, analyzing traffic patterns for sudden changes, comparing performance against industry benchmarks, and maintaining diversified traffic sources to reduce dependence on organic search alone.

Recovery from algorithm penalties requires identifying the issue through Search Console warnings or traffic pattern analysis, developing and implementing corrective action, submitting reconsideration requests if warranted, and documenting lessons learned to prevent recurrence.

---

## Resource Requirements and Investment

### Internal Resource Allocation

Successful execution requires dedicated resources rather than treating SEO as an occasional activity. Recommended internal allocation includes a marketing coordinator dedicating ten to fifteen hours weekly to content creation, review management, social media posting, and performance monitoring.

The business owner or senior leader should dedicate two to three hours weekly to strategy review, competitive analysis, video creation participation, and relationship building for link opportunities.

Field teams should dedicate one to two hours weekly to project photo documentation, customer review request delivery, and local market intelligence gathering.

### External Service Investment

Certain specialized activities benefit from external expertise. Recommended external services include technical SEO audit and implementation partner conducting quarterly audits, implementing technical recommendations, and maintaining site health; content creation support for blog writing, video production assistance, and graphic design; link building outreach specialist identifying opportunities, conducting personalized outreach, and tracking acquisition; and paid advertising management for Google Ads and social advertising campaign optimization and reporting.

Budget allocation should follow an eighty-twenty pattern with eighty percent toward owned media assets including website development, content creation, and owned channel optimization, and twenty percent toward paid advertising for immediate visibility while organic efforts mature.

### Technology Investment

Several software platforms support effective execution including local SEO platform such as BrightLocal, Moz Local, or Yext for citation management and monitoring; rank tracking software such as SEMrush, Ahrefs, or AccuRanker for keyword position monitoring; review management platform such as Podium, Birdeye, or Grade.us for review request automation and monitoring; social media management tool such as Hootsuite, Buffer, or Sprout Social for content scheduling and engagement; and project management system such as Asana, Monday, or Trello for campaign coordination and task tracking.

Total technology investment should range from three hundred to five hundred dollars monthly depending on platform selection and feature requirements.

## Gap Analysis vs. Codebase

- The current [ServiceAreaPage component](src/lib/components/ServiceAreaPage.svelte) now renders a hero with city-focused H1/H2, local climate/architectural context sections, FAQ accordion, testimonial/portfolio teaser, response-time callout, and video embed area so visitors get the depth required for Phase Two through Four.
- [src/lib/data/serviceAreas.ts](src/lib/data/serviceAreas.ts) now includes rich metadata for all service areas including climate risks, permit notes, seasonal recommendations, testimonials, FAQs, gallery references, and emergency logistics so the template can render unique local content per slug.
- There is no /blog route or structured content under src/routes/blog, so the blog cadence, pillar/spoke clusters, and video embedding strategy described in Phase Two and Phase Four have no home yet in the codebase.
- [src/lib/utils/seo.ts](src/lib/utils/seo.ts) only emits LocalBusiness/Service/Breadcrumb schemas; FAQ, Review, Video, and Article schema required by the plan are not generated today, limiting rich result eligibility.
- The current navigation ([src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte](src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte)) links to services, areas, gallery, testimonials, FAQ, and contact but has no entry points for the forthcoming blog, pillar pages, or localized landing pages that should be surfaced for internal linking.

## Implementation Tasklist

- [x] Expand the service-area template (src/lib/components/ServiceAreaPage.svelte) to follow the Phase Two playbook—add a city-focused H1/H2, local climate/architectural context, FAQ accordion, testimonial/portfolio teaser, response-time callout, and video embed area so each page reads like a standalone hub.
- [x] Extend the service-area dataset (src/lib/data/serviceAreas.ts or a new companion module) to include metadata from the plan such as climate risks, permit notes, seasonal recommendations, testimonials, FAQs, gallery references, and emergency logistics so the template can render unique local content per slug.
- [ ] Build the long-tail content pipeline by adding a /blog section (new src/routes/blog) that consumes structured content models, supports Article and VideoObject schema, and links from service and service-area pages, fulfilling the twice-monthly cadence described in Phase Two and Four.
- [ ] Enhance the SEO utility suite (src/lib/utils/seo.ts) with helpers for FAQ, Review, Video, and Article schema so every service/service-area/blog page can emit the markup described in Structured Data Expansion and Advanced Optimization.
- [ ] Strengthen internal linking and navigation (src/lib/components/Navigation.svelte plus the footer and CTA modules) to highlight the blog, service clusters, and prioritized service-area pages, ensuring crawlers and visitors can reach every important page within three clicks as required in the Technical Implementation section.
