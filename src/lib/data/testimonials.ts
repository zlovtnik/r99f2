    service: 'Structural Repair',
    text: 'The general contractor I hired completely exceeded my expectations when it came to fixing some significant structural issues in my new home\'s foundation. Their team walked me through every step of the process, explaining things in a way that was easy to understand and pointing out potential upgrades without pressuring me into anything unnecessary. They even took extra time to adjust their schedule after finding unexpected water damage during the inspection phase, which saved me from bigger problems down the road. The attention they gave to clean-up at the end of each day made living on-site throughout this project so much easier than I anticipated.',
